Ideas
-----

* compass pointing to a given field from current location (like trip advisor point me there)

* SMS / Email score reporting for captains. Online submit form or respond to a text / email
  * what about twitter?

* Online form to request water / food / observers or report an emergency

* slick JS based tournament bracket drawing

* Social and photographer integrations?

* needs to be super mobile friendly
