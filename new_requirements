Additional Requirements
  * conditionally create a bracket if the pool doesn't have a 3-0 winner.
  * Create a final game in a round robin based on who has not played

I am thinking of creating a ruby file for extra bracket rules ...
  * If I named these rules I could use a flag in brackets.yml
    to kick them off. (this way the behaviour is still linked
    to the model)

 ?? Do the order of the round robins matter ..?
    - probably not

 Should I enforce the day of games or leave that up to the TD? It should be obvious on the schedule view..

 --> There is notes for numbers in divisions in the USAU doc.
     Should I add this info? It includes the number of fields required ..

 --> Is num_teams in the json required anymore??
